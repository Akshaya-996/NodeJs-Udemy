npm
npm stands for "Node package Manager" and it allows
you to manage your Node project and its dependencies
You can initialize a project with npm init.
NPM scripts can be defined in the package.json to give 
you "shortcuts" to common tasks/commands

3rd party packages
Node projects typically don't just use core modules
and custom code but also third-party packages
You install them via npm
You can differentiate between production dependencies(--save),
development dependencies (--save-dev) and global dependencies(-g)

Type of errors
Syntax, runtime and logical errors can break your app
Syntax and runtime errors throw(helpful) error messages (with line numbers!)
Logical errors can be fixed with testing and the help of the debugger

Debugging
Use the VS Code Node debugger to step into your code and go
through it step by step
Analyze variable values at runtime
Look into (and manipulate) variables at runtime
Set breakpoints cleverly (i.e respect the async/event-driven nature).
