1. EJS is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. 
2. The general rendering process of Pug is simple. pug.compile() will compile the Pug source code into a JavaScript function that takes a data object (called “locals”) as an argument. Call that resultant function with your data, and voilà!, it will return a string of HTML rendered with your data.
2. HandleBars can be used to render web pages to the client side from data on the server side. To use handlebars in express, we need to store HTML code into a . hbs extension in the 'views' folder in the source directory as hbs looks for the pages in the views folder.
