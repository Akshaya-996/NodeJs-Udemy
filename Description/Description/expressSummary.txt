What is Express.js?
Is a node.js framework -  a package that adds a bunch of 
utility functions and tools and a clear set of rules on how
the app should be built (middleware!)
Its highly extensible and packages can be plugged into it(middleware!)

Middleware, next() and res()
Express relies heavily on middleware functions - you can easily add them by calling use()
Middleware functions handle a request and should call next() to forward the request to the next
function in line or send a response

Routing
You can filter requests by path and method
If you filter by method, paths are matched exactly,
otherwise, the first segment of url is matched
You can use the express.Router to split your routes 
across files elegantely

Server files
You're not limited to serving dummy text as a response
You can sendFile() to your users - e.g. HTML files
If you request is directly made for a file (e.g. a CSS file is requested),
you can enable static serving for such files via express.static()
