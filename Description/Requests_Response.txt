Request and Response Headers are key-value pairs sent along with HTTP requests and responses to provide additional context and metadata about the communication.
They enable functionality like authentication, content negotiation, caching, and more.

1. Request Headers
1.1 Common Request Headers
Header	                                            Purpose
Host	                              Specifies the domain name of the server.
User-Agent	                 Identifies the client making the request (e.g., browser, app, or bot).
Accept	                     Indicates the types of content the client can process (e.g., text/html).
Authorization	                    Sends credentials for authentication (e.g., Bearer <token>).
Content-Type	               Specifies the media type of the request body (e.g., application/json).
Cookie	                                  Sends stored cookies to the server.
Referer	                               Indicates the URL of the referring page.
Accept-Encoding	              Indicates the encoding formats the client supports (e.g., gzip).
Cache-Control	                       Controls caching behavior for the request.
1.2 Custom Request Headers
Custom headers are defined by the application. They usually start with X- (e.g., X-Request-ID).

2. Response Headers
2.1 Common Response Headers
Header	                        Purpose
Content-Type	                Specifies the media type of the response (e.g., application/json).
Content-Length	                Specifies the size of the response body in bytes.
Cache-Control	                Instructs how clients should cache the response.
ETag	                        Provides a unique identifier for a resource to optimize caching.
Set-Cookie	                    Sets cookies on the client.
Location	                    Used in redirects to specify the new URL.
Content-Encoding	            Indicates the encoding of the response body (e.g., gzip).
Access-Control-Allow-Origin	    Defines allowed origins for cross-origin requests (CORS).
Retry-After	                    Suggests when the client should retry a failed request.

3. Header Use Cases
3.1 Authentication
Request: Authorization: Bearer <token>
Response: WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="Access to the site"

3.2 Content Negotiation
Request:
Accept: application/json
Response:
Content-Type: application/json

3.3 Caching
Request:
Cache-Control: no-cache
Response:
Cache-Control: max-age=3600

3.4 Compression
Request:
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Response:
Content-Encoding: gzip

4. Example of Headers in Action
4.1 Request Headers
GET /api/data HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Bearer abc123
4.2 Response Headers
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 123
Cache-Control: max-age=3600
ETag: "abc123"

5. Inspecting Headers
Headers can be inspected using tools like:

Browser Developer Tools:
Go to the "Network" tab and click on a request.
Postman:
Headers tab allows customization and viewing.
Command Line (curl):
curl -I http://example.com
This shows response headers.

7. Best Practices for Headers
Avoid exposing sensitive data in headers.
Use Content-Type to define the format of data being sent or received.
Implement proper caching with Cache-Control and ETag.
Always validate and sanitize input for security headers like Authorization.
Use CORS headers (Access-Control-Allow-*) to control cross-origin access.
